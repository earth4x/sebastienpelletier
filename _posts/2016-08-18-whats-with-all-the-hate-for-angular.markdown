Seriously, I feel like recently there's been a smear campaign going on. Angular 1's performance is crap. Angular 2 is not going to take off and is complicated. ReactJS is the best thing ever !!!!! **#reactForever #AngularIsBad**

I don't really understand it, and frankly I'm wondering why so many people are hating on Angular. I will say that I use Angular on a daily basis, but I also use other tools, frameworks & libraries, so this article will not be 'Angular biased'... that's the last thing I would want to do.

# Where it all started
Talk about the history of Angular and when it was born. When React came out... what people said about it... Angular 2...

# React comes along

# Angular 2, the answer to React?

# Conclusion
Whether you use React, Vue, Ember, Angular 1, Angular 2... there are no wrong choices. Of course, some frameworks are more suited for specific things, and some frameworks will eventually be deprecated due to lack of new features and newer frameworks that come around, but that doesn't mean that a specific framework is better then the other.

We should be happy that we now have all of these solutions available to us as developers to create these amazing apps and websites. And even when you think about it, these days you can use the same language, Javascript in this instance, to write both the Back-End and Front-End. And you can even write a native Windows, Mac & Linux app in Javascript when using Electron.

To me that just means that we are living in exciting times when it comes to web development, and even development in general. We have so many options available to us, it's a shame that we have to downplay other solutions.
