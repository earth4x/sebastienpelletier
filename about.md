Hi, my name is Sebastien Pelletier. I'm a 30 years old Technical Team Lead @iBwave based in Montreal, Québec. I've been passionate about web development for 15 years and I love the fact that it's a constantly changing and evolving domain.

My main background is HTML, CSS & Javascript. These things I mostly dabble with AngularJS and all around it. NodeJS, Bower, Grunt, etc... all these things are part of my daily life.

# Blogging & Teaching
Some of you might ask, why are you starting a blog now? Well, I've been wanting to write on web development for a long time, but other obligations and lack of motivation kept me from doing it. I'm a family man, but there comes a time in your life where you feel like you want to help others.

In this case, I want to help people get better at their craft. From my years of experience I've learned alot, and I want to pass my knowledge on to others, so that they can improve their skills, but also get the urge to start blogging themselves, so we can all help each other.

# Purpose
What's nice about web development and technologies is that we're all part of the team. We're all on the same boat, trying to create something unique and we have a passion for it. Everyday I'm reminded that I chose the right path in my career, I'm doing what I love everyday, and now I get to teach others !

This is the purpose of this blog, I want to teach others about the little things... These little experiences that I went through, the things I've learned, the rough patches and everything in between. There are no stupid questions, and my goal is that someone, somewhere, will write a development question on a search engine, thinking nobody has ever done something similar... but he will be redirected here, to my blog, where a detailed article with code examples will direct him in the right path.

# Conferences & Speaking
I've had the privilege of visiting a couple of conferences and events over the years. At this point, I might be even thinking about being a presenter myself, but the opportunity just hasn't arrived yet. It's something I'm thinking about doing eventually, so if you feel like I have a subject that would be good to talk about in a conference, get in touch with me through Twitter (link)
